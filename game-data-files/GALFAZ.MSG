Thinking of taking a vacation?

Well, you were, and then something happened.  As a seasoned intergalactic
traveler, you are accustomed to the occasional hyperspace grid interlock,
or matter-transmitter hiccup.

But this is something else entirely!  You were just beaming down to FAZUUL,
playground pleasure planet of the galactic elite, when all of a sudden
the vortex cannonballed, the goonplasm deflated, and the freplishers skrank
out.  You are left standing on the tarmac in front of a large, deserted
alien city.

The welcoming committee is absent.  The vacationland spa hosts and
hostesses have all mysteriously disappeared.  You have reached FAZUUL,
all right, but your vacation is over, and your nightmare has just begun.

As you gaze around in dismay, you may be wondering "What in the Nine
Moons of Jupiter is this??".  This is a multi-user online adventure game.
It is something along the lines of Zork, Deadline, and so on, but with a
key difference: many people can play at once, and they are all in the
SAME simulated universe.  The program that generates this universe is
like an automated dungeon master in "Dungeons and Dragons"... one that
plays no favorites, makes no mistakes, and has the capacity to track a
large number of individuals or groups completely independently of one
another.

FAZUUL was originally a harsh, forbidding world of intense dry heat and
endless rolling sand dunes.  It had been inhabited, millions of years
earlier, by a strange alien civilization of which little is known.  The
aliens all died out long ago of mysterious biological causes, leaving
their technology behind.

Then humans came along, and, through the miracles of kwish-age
engineering, FAZUUL was transformed into a beautiful leisure paradise,
fully equipped with all the essentials of the up-to-date resort planet.

You can talk to other players in your immediate vicinity by typing the
word "say", followed by whatever it is you want to say to them.  If you
want your voice to carry further, use "shout" or "yell".  Everyone
within hearing distance will hear you.

If you want to communicate privately with another player in your
immediate area, you can type "whisper to <so-and-so>", followed by your
confidential message -- other players nearby will only know that you
have whispered something, not what it is you whispered.

You move around by telling FAZUUL the direction in which you want to
move: north, south, east, or west.  Sometimes, depending on the
situation, other moves will also make sense.  FAZUUL keeps track of the
last five places you have visited, and gives you the full description of
the place only if it is not one of these last five.  You may tell FAZUUL
to always give you short place-descriptions by typing "brief" (this may
be undone by typing "nonbrief").

You can trade crackers, goods, services, and information with other
players any time you like, in any way you like.  Typing "give

the player you specify, assuming that (a) you possessed it in the first
place, and (b) the specified player is in your immediate area.  The item
can be either a device you are holding, or a count of crackers (for
example, "GIVE 5 CRACKERS TO BEELZEBUB").  The terms and conditions of
any sale are entirely yours to work out with your co-conspirator.

The original inhabitants of FAZUUL all perished thousands of years ago of
biological causes, leaving behind odd bits and pieces of incredibly
advanced technology.  The technology takes the form of the various
objects with strange names that you find lying around here and there.
Since they are based on advanced alien technology, their various purposes
may not be apparent to you at first, but by experimenting around with
them you may find that some of them have amazing properties.

You can also assemble the objects together in various ways to make more
complex and interesting devices (e.g. "ATTACH THE GWINGUS TO THE
MONGOO").  These combined devices can then be further combined, and so
on.  A major portion of the information you will be trading with other
players relates to which devices combine with which others, what they do
when combined, how you activate them, the side effects they might have,
and so on.

To quit FAZUUL, type "exit", or just "x".  Your player will be placed
into "hypospatial stasis," which means that you will vanish from the
FAZUUL universe but that your complete status will be saved, awaiting
your return to the game.  Any objects you are holding go into hypospatial
stasis with you, so that you can pick up playing again right where you
left off.

distance to the east, and the air is filled with flying craft of every
possible sort and description.  All at once a small craft approaches you
at a steep angle and lands next to you on the platform.  The side of the
craft abruptly parts, and a five-tentacled alien climbs out and
undulates away toward the city.  Looking inside the ship for the
controls, you notice that it seems to have none, but there is a set of
tables inscribed into one wall.  You notice that the tables seem to
consist of numbers, inscribed in groups of four, three groups per line
in each case followed by some cryptic cuneiform writing.  As you lean
forward to examine the tables more closely, you feel yourself losing
your balance, and falling... falling... falling... and then the vision
has passed and you find that you have fallen off the platform.

about in some sort of cavernous chamber filled with machinery.  A voice
suddenly seems to come into your head, saying: "Welcome to the

into your head from some unseen source: "W-welcome to the

across the muzzle of his unholstered scroom, then undulating casually
over to snatch up the nebbish the first one had dropped.  Another, more
mature voice now eases in over the uproar: "Be sure.  Be protected.

center; the left-hand lobe of the figure consists of, in clockwise
order, ormush, kleng, and noodiddle; and the right-hand lobe encompasses
pleebor, oomwazzitz, and neblin.

"The object of the game is to slap the foon-ball just as it finishes
tracing a path of three consecutive positions that follow the
figure-eight.  For example, ormush-fong-pleebor is a winning pattern;
but oomwazzitz-neblin-noodiddle is not.  Most non-winning slaps are not
fatal.  HOWEVER: Any attempt to slap the foon-ball just after it has
"crossed the middle" of either lobe of the playfield results in a loss
to the player that slapped the ball.

eight feet tall, dark-haired, with what appears to be the scar of an old
bullet wound on his left cheek.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1739 {[0;1;32m is surrounded by a faintly glowing aura of leashed energy.  He is about
six feet tall, light-haired, with what appears to be an old fishing scar on his
right cheek.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1740 {[0;1;32m looks like the impatient sort.  His sweaty face is a dark shade of
purple, and he seems to be tapping one foot on the ground so fast that you
can barely see it.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1741 {[0;1;32m is a sharp-nosed, inquisitive-looking type, about five and a half feet
tall, with dark, oily hair.  You cannot help wondering if he would like to
give you some crackers.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1742 {[0;1;32m is a sharp-nosed, inquisitive-looking type, about five and a half feet
tall, with dark, oily hair.  You cannot help wondering if he has a mother-in-law
named Ozelko.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1743 {[0;1;32m is a sharp-nosed, inquisitive-looking type, about five and a half feet
tall, with dark, oily hair.  You cannot help wondering if he has a nebbish
hidden away somewhere.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1744 {[0;1;32m is a sharp-nosed, inquisitive-looking type, about five and a half feet
tall, with dark, oily hair.  You cannot help wondering if he is working on
a novel in his spare time.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1745 {[0;1;32m has become a small bread-basket, with a shelf-life of several weeks.
A small sign over his head blinks repeatedly: "Fish No More".  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1746 {[0;1;32m is apparently undergoing a metamorphosis from the form of a
hippopotamus to that of a buttercup.  A soft wheezing sound emits from his left
armpit/leaf-structure, a portion of his anatomy you decide you would just as
soon not investigate further.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1747 {[0;1;32m is wearing a name-badge identifying himself as an Inspector of
Unspecified Proportionalities, but you notice that the green headdress normally
accorded such functionaries is conspicuously missing.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1748 {[0;1;32m has become almost uniformly orange, but you notice a small mole just
beneath his left ear that seems to be blinking on and off in a shade of
pale yellow.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1749 {[0;1;32m is surrounded by a cloud of small, gnat-like creatures, all singing
in unison, "When the Saints Come Marching In".  He seems to be enjoying
the music, as far as you can tell.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1750 {[0;1;32m has the look of a desperate fugitive about him, but you feel certain
that his mother loves him.  Looking closely, you notice a small tear forming
in the corner of his right eye.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1751 {[0;1;32m is apparently masquerading as the Duke of York, but the raccoon
nesting in his left ear is a dead giveaway.  He is trying to combat the smell
of the dead raccoon with Old Spice, but to no avail.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1752 {[0;1;32m has a serious case of Uncorgling's Disease, which makes him seem much
less unpopular than he actually is.  A spare set of kelp bladders is dangling
on a chain from his belt.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1753 {[0;1;32m has the look of a man plotting the overthrow of the galaxy.
Unfortunately, he cannot seem to escape the holographic image of the small
backyard rotisserie that follows him around, sometimes in front, sometimes
behind.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1754 {[0;1;32m has a distracted look about him, as though torn between a desire to
discover new life, new civilizations, and a desire to eat some fresh
marmalade.  Why he supposes these are mutually exclusive, you cannot tell.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1755 {[0;1;32m appears to be wearing a special projector that makes his nose seem
several times its actual size.  However, the small radar dome on his head
forces you to conclude that he works for the military.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1756 {[0;1;32m is appropriately attired for the occasion in a high-necked, stiff
white collar and blue velvet bellbottoms.  You seem to recall having seen
him before on one of those tri-D newscasts.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1757 {[0;1;32m has evidently gotten fed up with feeding the ducks all the time,
since he has no stale bread anywhere on his person.  However, looking closely,
you notice the telltale stains of yeast contamination on the thumb and
forefinger of his left hand.  He} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1758 {[0;1;32m is an average-looking fellow of medium build.  He} T FAZUUL description

FAZ1801 {[0;1;32m...Please, this is a family game -- no obscenity when talking to other players.
You can cuss at your own terminal all you like, but not over the network.
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1817 {[0;1;32m...If you would like to restart your session, type "restart now".  This will
cause you to dematerialize and reappear at the city's spaceport again, as
though you were just starting the game for the first time.  Don't forget, this
means you will lose any objects you happen to be carrying at the time.
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1818 {[0;1;32m...Your vision is suddenly obscured by a scintillating cloud of white mist!
You feel a whirling, swirling motion, as though you are caught in a subspace
vortex, and all of the objects you are carrying are ripped from your grasp!
Then the motion slowly subsides and your vision clears...

FAZ1824 {[0;1;32m...It's up to you to work out the details of the trade with the other player
(type "help trading" for more information).

} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1829 {[0;1;32m...Ooh, it squirmed and gasped as you did that!
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1830 {[0;1;32m...You can't, you aren't wearing your jump suit!
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1831 {[0;1;32m...You don't seem to be able to get a good grip.
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1832 {[0;1;32m...All right you wisacre, let's stop fooling around and play the game now, huh?
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1833 {[0;1;32m...Considering that, for the purpose of this game, you and I are one and the
same, that would be quite an accomplishment!
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1834 {[0;1;32m...Yeah, let's swing!  Doe-si-doe now, two-by-two...
} T FAZUUL description


FAZ1835 {[0;1;32m...You can't, you don't seem to have a pen.

OOGFRE {[0;1;32m***
Suddenly, the oolgorboid begins to writhe and undulate!  Then it emits an
ear-piercing screech and lies still again.
