
    FAZUUL
    ------

    You have arrived on FAZUUL, a lush pleasure planet discovered years ago
    by a number of shipwrecked space captains.  At the time of its
    discovery, FAZUUL was a harsh, forbidding world of intense dry heat and
    endless rolling sand dunes.  Now, however, through the miracles of
    kwish-age engineering, FAZUUL has been transformed into a beautiful
    leisure paradise, fully equipped with all of the essentials of the
    up-to-date resort planet.

    Due to a quantum fluctuation of the void, however, the entire tourist
    mass transit system on FAZUUL has been incapacitated.  Vacationers can
    beam in but they can't beam back out!

    Or can they?  As a marooned vacationer on this paradise planet, you and
    your fellow marooned vacationers may be able to figure out the alien
    technology lying around, pool your resources and knowledge, and find a
    way to escape.  Or, if you like, you can spend your time playing the
    various Galactic games that have been installed as part of the resort's
    facilities, such as Foon-Ball and Umflungoo.  Or, you are free to just
    explore around, talk with other players, fight with them, or whatever
    you like!


    Talking

    You can talk to other players in your immediate vicinity by typing the
    word "say", followed by whatever it is you want to say to them.  If you
    want your voice to carry further, use "shout" or "yell".  Everyone
    within hearing distance will hear you.

    If you want to communicate privately with another player in your
    immediate area, you can type "whisper to so-and-so", followed by your
    confidential message -- other players nearby will only know that you
    have whispered something, not what it is you whispered.


    Moving around

    You move around by telling FAZUUL the direction in which you want to
    move:  north, south, east, or west (or just N, S, E, or W for short).
    Sometimes, depending on the situation, other moves will also make
    sense.  FAZUUL keeps track of the last five places you have visited,
    and gives you the full description of the place only if it is not one
    of these last five.  You may tell FAZUUL to always give you short
    place-descriptions by typing "brief" (this may be undone by typing
    "nonbrief").


    Trading

    You can trade crackers, goods, services, and information with other
    players any time you like, in any way you like.  Typing "give
    such-and-such to so-and-so" will cause the item to be transferred to
    the player you specify, assuming that (a) you possessed it in the first
    place, and (b) the specified player is in your immediate area.  The
    item can be either a device you are holding, or a count of crackers
    (for example, "GIVE 5 CRACKERS TO BEELZEBUB").  The terms and
    conditions of any sale are entirely yours to work out with your
    co-conspirator.


    Exiting the game

    To quit FAZUUL, type "exit", or just "x".  Your player will be placed
    into "hypospatial stasis", which means that you will vanish from the
    FAZUUL universe but that your complete status will be saved, awaiting
    your return to the game.  Any objects you are holding go into
    hypospatial stasis with you, so that you can pick up playing again
    right where you left off.

    If you are lost in the jungle or something and merely wish to restart
    the game afresh, just type "restart".


    Strategy

    The original inhabitants of FAZUUL all perished thousands of years ago
    of biological causes, leaving behind odd bits and pieces of incredibly
    advanced technology.  The technology takes the form of the various
    objects with strange names that you find lying around here and there.
    Since they are based on advanced alien technology, their various
    purposes may not be apparent to you at first, but by experimenting
    around with them you may find that some of them have amazing
    properties.

    You can also assemble the objects together in various ways to make more
    complex and interesting devices (e.g.  "ATTACH THE GWINGUS TO THE
    MONGOO").  These combined devices can then be further combined, and so
    on.  A major portion of the information you will be trading with other
    players relates to which devices combine with which others, what they
    do when combined, how you activate them, the side effects they might
    have, and so on.


    Getting help

    Once you're in the game, help is available on all of these topics.
    Just type "help" from inside FAZUUL for more information.
